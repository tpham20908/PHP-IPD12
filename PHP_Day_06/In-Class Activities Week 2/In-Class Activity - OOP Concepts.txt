This is a conceptual exercise, not a PHP coding exercise.

Step-by-Step
=============
Based on the contacts in Figure 11-About Us, write down the properties and methods that a Contact object might need.

1. The properties are the pieces of information about the Contact.
Properties include the following:
• First name
• Last name
• Position
• Email
• Phone

2. The methods are functions that the object would need.
• A method that assembles a full name from first name and last name.

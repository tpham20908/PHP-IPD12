PHP Basic Features 2 
====================
You can attach two string values together. They can either be actual strings or variables that have strings in them. This is called concatenation. You use a period (.) to concatenate the different strings:

<?php
$firstName = 'Andy';
$lastName = 'Tarr';
$myVar = 'Hi, my name is ' . $firstName. ' ' . $lastName . '.';
echo $myVar;
?>

Working with String Functions
=============================
PHP Functions do not start with a dollar sign and they are immediately followed by parentheses.

♦ strlen()
String Length returns the length of the string. The following function returns a result of 4:
<?php
$myName = 'Andy';
echo strlen($myName);
?>

♦ htmlspecialchars()
HTML Special Characters takes a string and converts &, <, >, and double quotes to proper HTML entities.

<p> Quantity must be > 5 or < 10 </p>

<?php
$myName = 'Andy & Amos';
echo htmlspecialchars($myName);
?>
This code displays "Andy & Amos," but if you look at the source for the browser page, you see "Andy &amp; Amos."

♦ ucfirst()
Upper Case First changes the first character to uppercase. The following function returns a result of "The book of days":
<?php
$myVar = 'the book of days';
echo ucfirst($myVar);
?>

♦ ucwords()
Upper Case Words changes the first character of each word to uppercase. The following function returns "The Book Of Days":
<?php
$myVar = 'the book of days';
echo ucwords($myVar);
?>

♦ trim()
Trim removes any blank characters from the beginning and end of the string. The following function returns "the book of days":
<?php
$myVar = '      the book of days ';
echo trim($myVar);
?>

♦ strtolower()
String to Lower converts any uppercase letters to lowercase. The following function returns "the book of days":
<?php
$myVar = 'THE BOOK OF DAYS';
echo strtolower($myVar);
?>

♦ strtoupper()
String to Upper converts any lowercase letters to uppercase. The following function returns "THE BOOK OF DAYS":
<?php
$myVar = 'the book of days';
echo strtoupper($myVar);
?>


You can nest the functions as well. The following code converts the text to lowercase and then capitalizes the first letter of each word, resulting in "The Book of Days":
<?php
$myVar = 'THE BOOK OF daYs';
echo ucwords(strtolower($myVar));
?>

CHANGING BETWEEN TEXT AND NUMBERS
=================================
Various functions and operations require that the variables be of a particular type. For instance, you can multiply only numeric variables. PHP quietly converts variables to the right data type if it can. In the following code, $stringNumber is automatically converted to a number and 15 is displayed:

<?php
$stringNumber = '3';
$number = 5;
echo $stringNumber * $number;
?>

Here, the $stringNumber is converted to 15, giving 75 as the result:
<?php
$stringNumber = '15a4';
$number = 5;
echo $stringNumber * $number;
?>

And here, the $stringNumber is converted to 0, giving the result as 0 as well:
<?php
$stringNumber = 'aaa';
$number = 5;
echo $stringNumber * $number;
?>

The following code uses concatenation, which expects string variables. The variables are converted to strings and the result displayed is 35.
<?php
$stringNumber = 3;
$number = 5;
echo $stringNumber . $number;
?>

Here's another string function that takes a fl oat number and displays it as a formatted string. Because it expects $number to be a floating-point number, it converts it from a string to a float:
<?php
$number = '15';
echo number_format($number, 2);
?>

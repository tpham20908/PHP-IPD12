Repeating Program Steps
========================
Loops let you repeat blocks of code multiple times. Depending on the type of loop, you can repeat the code a given amount of times or while a certain condition is true.

♦ WHILE LOOPS
While loops execute a block of while a given condition is true. This is the syntax of a while loop:
while (condition) {
lines of code here;
as many as you need;
}

As with the other control structures, the while loop also has the alternative syntax that is preferred if you are mixing PHP and HTML:

while (condition) :
lines of code here;
as many as you need;
endwhile;


♦ DO/WHILE LOOPS
The do/while loops are the same as while loops except that the condition is checked after running the block of code instead of before. While loops that start with a false condition never run; do/while loops always run at least once.
Following is the syntax for a do/while loop. The do/while loop does not have an alternate syntax.

do {
lines of code here;
as many as you need;
} while (condition);

Here is the same example as the while loop, refactored as a do/while loop. 

<h1>Print 1 through 4</h1>
<?php
$i = 1;
do {
echo "<p>The counter is $i.";
$i++;
} while ($i < 5);


♦ FOR LOOPS
The for loops execute a block of code a given number of times. Unlike while loops, for loops handle the incrementing/decrementing of the counter for you. This is the syntax of the for loop: 

for (init; condition; increment) {
lines of code here;
as many as you need;
}

The for loop has alternative syntax as well:

for (init; condition; increment) :
lines of code here;
as many as you need;
endfor;

Following is the same function used for the while loop, but refactored as a for loop. 

<h1>Print 1 through 4</h1>
<?php
for ($i=1; $i < 5; $i++) {
echo "<p>The counter is $i.";
}


♦ FOREACH LOOPS
The foreach loop is a simple way of looping through all the elements in an array or object. Although you could do the same thing with a for loop, using a foreach loop is less complex and gives you advantages. This is the standard syntax:

foreach ($array as $element) {
code to be executed using $element;
}


<h1>Contacts</h1>
<?php
$contacts = array(
array('name' => 'George Smith', 'email' => 'george@example.com'),
array('name' => 'Sally Carpenter', 'email' => 'sally@example.com'),
array('name' => 'Peter Jason', 'email' => 'peter@example.com'),
array('name' => 'Lila Carhausen', 'email' => 'lila@example.com')
);
?>
<ul>
<?php foreach ($contacts as $contact) : ?>
<li><?php echo $contact['name']; ?><br />
<?php echo $contact['email']; ?></li>
<?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>

If the array you are looping through is an associative array you can keep track of the index with the following syntax:

foreach ($array as $key=>$value) {
code to be executed using $element and/or $key;
}
foreach ($array as $key=>$element) :
code to be executed using $element and/or ;
endforeach;


In the following code you loop through the array and use each key as a label for displaying the value. 
<h1>Contact</h1>
<?php
$myArr = array('name' => 'George Smith',
'email' => 'george@example.com',
'phone' => '555-555-1212',
'state' => 'MA');
?>
<ul>
<?php foreach ($myArr as $key=>$value) : ?>
<li><?php echo ucfirst($key); ?>:
<?php echo $value; ?></li>
<?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>


♦ CONTINUE/BREAK
You use continue if you are done with a particular loop iteration and want to jump to the start of the next iteration. In the following example, the email value is skipped:

<h1>Contact</h1>
<?php
$myArr = array('name' => 'George Smith',
'email' => 'george@example.com',
'phone' => '555-555-1212',
'state' => 'MA');
?>
<ul>
<?php foreach ($myArr as $key=>$value) :
if ($key == 'email') :
continue;
endif; ?>
<li><?php echo ucfirst($key); ?>:
<?php echo $value; ?></li>
<?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>

If you have multiple nested loops, you can use a numeric argument to skip to the next iteration of enclosing loops.

Display Errors while Developing
You want errors to be displayed for you while you are developing your code. To do this, make sure that display_errors is on in your php.ini file. You can check this by running phpinfo(). If you are using XAMPP, display_errors is on by default because it is set up for development, not production. This is the code for running phpinfo():
<?php
phpinfo();

If your display_errors is not on, edit the php.ini file so display_errors is on. If you are using XAMPP, the php.ini file is located at c:\xampp\php on a Windows PC and at /Applications/XAMPP/Xamppfiles/etc on a Mac OS X.

	display_errors = on

	display_errors determines if reported errors are displayed. error_reporting determines which errors should be reported. Errors have different levels, from minor notices to warning to severe.
	
Your error reporting level is also listed on the phpinfo() report, but it is in machine-readable code, so it is easier to look in your php.ini file. A good level for developing is to show all errors except for notices. The tilde (~) prefixed to E_NOTICE provides direction to not show those errors.

	error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE

	If you want to make sure you get all notices, including if you have a defined variable, do not exclude the notices. This is helpful if you have typos or problems remembering the right cases.
	
	error_reporting = E_ALL

	If you want to go one step further, you can also display errors that donâ€™t meet very strict PHP standards. The pipe symbol (|) means to display if the error violates E_ALL or E_STRICT.
	
	error_reporting = E_ALL | E_STRICT


If you make changes to php.ini, be sure to stop your Apache web server and start it again.

Take a look at what the errors look like when they are reported. Can you fi nd the error in the following code?
<?php
$firstName = 'Andy';
$nameLength = str_len($firstName);
$myVar = 'Hi, my name is ' . $nameLength. ' letters long.';
echo $myVar;
